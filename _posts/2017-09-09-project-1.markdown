description: At MedHacks 2017 my team and I built a Android app that used accelerometer and voice input to track tremor levels of Parkinson patients and recommend appropriate follow-up action. I was responsible was the development of the Android app and UI/UX design. We won the access to care track and 3rd prize overall.
